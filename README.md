# README

This repository is a fork of [libapps-mirror](https://github.com/libapps/libapps-mirror), which is a mirror of [libapps](https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/).

The aim of this project was to add mounting support to wash (Web Application Shell). Currently all NaCl ports could be launched through wash via SaltPig. This project aims to unite them with wash directly, so that they all share the same sandbox and can view the same file systems that are mounted by the user through wash.

Documentation coming soon.
