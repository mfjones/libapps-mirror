# README

## Introduction

This repository is a fork of [libapps-mirror](https://github.com/libapps/libapps-mirror), which is a mirror of [libapps](https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/).

The aim of this project was to add mounting support to wash (Web Application Shell). Currently all NaCl ports could be launched through wash via SaltPig. This project aims to unite them with wash directly, so that they all share the same sandbox and can view the same file systems that are mounted by the user through wash.

## Running wash

To get wash up and running, see the Google doc located here: [https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1unlDpK1Jd0oDoHVl0Nfv12Xhdv_PbPrUSTb-zl6T5VE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1unlDpK1Jd0oDoHVl0Nfv12Xhdv_PbPrUSTb-zl6T5VE/edit?usp=sharing).

For details on how wash works, or if you want to add your own NaCl port to wash, see the document here: [https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/10aWnw_eRtFvYGv5TXpPJWivctzOeR4AvB-CQISh6aKs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/10aWnw_eRtFvYGv5TXpPJWivctzOeR4AvB-CQISh6aKs/edit?usp=sharing).
